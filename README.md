# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this challenge, we are helping out a ride sharing company called PyBer to understand and analyze how the company is doing in different city types and various economic backgrounds of the consumers. We will analyze the economic trends of the three different city types, which are Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and how the fares are impacting the drivers and the number of rides that each city types are performing. The data we will be looing at are the 2019 data, and through conducting analysis through CSV, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks, we are data framing various data types to show how the company can improve the ridesharing services.

The resources used to analyze this challenge are listed below:
- [city_data.csv](https://github.com/johnl9152/PyBer_Analysis/files/7610068/city_data.csv)
- [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/johnl9152/PyBer_Analysis/files/7610069/ride_data.csv)

The chart above shows the overall PyBer ride sharing data in 2019. It shows the three different city types of Urban, Suburban, and Rural with the x-axis representing total numbers of rides per city and y-axis showing the average fares in US dollars($). Bigger circle shows more drivers in the specific cities with the correlating rider fares.

The figure shows the box-and-whisker chart of ride count data in 2019 and pie chart of percent of total rides by city type. In the box-and-whisker chart, the most riders used with PyBer is in urban cities and the lowest usage is in rural cities. The average ridesharing in urban cities is around 24 rides, and the average ridesharing in rural cities is around 6 cities. However, there is an outlier of 39 rides in one city. As reflected in pie chart, 68.4% of the total population of PyBer users in 2019 has used in the urban areas, and 5.3% of the total population of PyBer users in 2019 has used in the rural areas.

The graphs above shows the number of drivers in each city types. For urban cities, there is a variety of drivers in urban cities ranging from 4 drivers to 74 drivers per cities. However, there is a low number of drivers in rural cities, with maximum drivers of 9 in a city and the lowest of 0 PyBer driver in a city. The pie chart will also be reflected from the box-and-whisker chart, with 80.9% drivers are from urban cities and 2.6% drivers from rural cities. The suburban PyBer drivers are not that noticeable compared to the drastic number difference between urban and rural, but it could be noticed by company developers for better marketing strategies.
