# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this challenge, we are helping out a ride sharing company called PyBer to understand and analyze how the company is doing in different city types and various economic backgrounds of the consumers. We will analyze the economic trends of the three different city types, which are Urban, Suburban, and Rural, and how the fares are impacting the drivers and the number of rides that each city types are performing. The data we will be looing at are the 2019 data, and through conducting analysis through CSV, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks, we are data framing various data types to show how the company can improve the ridesharing services.

The resources used to analyze this challenge are listed below:
- [city_data.csv](https://github.com/johnl9152/PyBer_Analysis/files/7610068/city_data.csv)
- [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/johnl9152/PyBer_Analysis/files/7610069/ride_data.csv)

The chart above shows the overall PyBer ride sharing data in 2019. It shows the three different city types of Urban, Suburban, and Rural with the x-axis representing total numbers of rides per city and y-axis showing the average fares in US dollars($). Bigger circle shows more drivers in the specific cities with the correlating rider fares.

The figure shows the box-and-whisker chart of ride count data in 2019 and pie chart of percent of total rides by city type. In the box-and-whisker chart, the most riders used with PyBer is in urban cities and the lowest usage is in rural cities. The average ridesharing in urban cities is around 24 rides, and the average ridesharing in rural cities is around 6 cities. However, there is an outlier of 39 rides in one city. As reflected in pie chart, 68.4% of the total population of PyBer users in 2019 has used in the urban areas, and 5.3% of the total population of PyBer users in 2019 has used in the rural areas.

The graphs above shows the number of drivers in each city types. For urban cities, there is a variety of drivers in urban cities ranging from 4 drivers to 74 drivers per cities. However, there is a low number of drivers in rural cities, with maximum drivers of 9 in a city and the lowest of 0 PyBer driver in a city. The pie chart will also be reflected from the box-and-whisker chart, with 80.9% drivers are from urban cities and 2.6% drivers from rural cities. The suburban PyBer drivers are not that noticeable compared to the drastic number difference between urban and rural, but it could be noticed by company developers for better marketing strategies.

Finally, we have reached to diagram the fare counts by city types in order to complie all of the data we have collected into a simpler and much easier to read overall. In the box-and-whisker diagram, the rural cities have higher fare than the ones in the suburbs and cities. Due to the low demands in the rurals, the ridesharings are higher in pricing point than the ones in the cities and suburbs. Likewise as in terms of supply and demands, cities have lower average fares compared to rural cities, reaching the price point of $25 dollars compared to $36 in the rural cities. In the pie chart, the urban cities take up most of the percent of the total fares by city type. The suburban percenteage of total fares is in the middle, and the rural cities have the lowest percentage of total fares by city type. In the last diagram, the three various lines represent the city types: blue is rural, red is suburban, and yellow is urban. From the all the graphs we talked about, rural cities has the lowest average fare and urban cities has the highest average fare, especially during March. 

## Summary
To conclude this analysis, we have three recommendations to the company so that they could improve upon the data we analyzed displayed.
1. The rural city drivers are suffering a lot of losses compared to the urban city drivers. They are always the lowest number in the PyBer ridesharing company. In order to improve the average ridesharing numbers and decreasing the average fares, they could provide deals and offers to the customers with various different economic backgrounds to use the service that they have in the cities.
2. Despite having a detailed amount of numbers and data, the time span looks too short to be analyzing for the future of the company. By looking at the first quarter of the year, it is difficult to forecast the yearly plan and analysis for the options and choice for the company.
3. Furthermore, there are a lot of different people in all cities, like economic background, education, age, sex, and more. Not having enough data could be hurtful for the company to not deeply analyze enough in order to positively grow and be successful when dealing with competition. By dissecting more data, the company can be advantageous to the growth for the following years to come.
